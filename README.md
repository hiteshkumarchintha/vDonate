What’s the issue? 
The amount of food that goes straight into trash cans is as alarming as 50 kg of food per person every year just in India according to the Food Waste Index Report 2021, which would account to a colossal count if considered on a global level. This is merely an indication that an average individual who can afford tries to consume a lot more than required and ends up wasting most of these resources, creating a scope of unavailability to those who are in dire need of them. 

What do we intend to do?
This app is a one stop solution which aims to bring a drop in the food wastage crisis in an attempt to reach out to as many people as possible. We intend to connect food donors and the people who are in dire need of it in and around those localities, which indeed would not be possible without our app and delivery agents bridging the gap.

What does our app do?
In order to resolve this issue we’ve developed a web application using Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MongoDB that could also serve as an add-on to existing food delivery giants like Swiggy and Zomato.
This app’s primary functions include:
User filling the pick up cart details with an estimate on how many people would the leftover serve.
Scheduling for a nearby delivery agent to pick up the cart.
Once the cart is picked up by the delivery agent it would be dropped off at the nearest group of needy who match the count mentioned by the user.
Once the cart is dropped off, the user is informed regarding the same and their request is then closed.
When in association with existing food delivery giants like Swiggy and Zomato this would also include a feature that would let the user schedule a leftover pick up while ordering in food.
